0,7 Summers,Morgan Wallen,Country,"Yeah, you used to talk about Getting even further South Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now Maybe a baby or a couple by now Long driveway to a big white house  But I wonder when you're drinking if you Find yourself thinking about That boy from East Tennessee And I know we both knew better But we still said forever And that was seven summers Of Coke and Southern Comfort Were we dumb or just younger, who knows? Back then, you used to love the river And sippin' on a sixer with me Does it ever make you sad to know That was seven summers ago?  Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud Of how his little girl turned out Think she dodged a bullet Of a good old boy like me 'Cause I still Go drinkin', same friends on Friday Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway Guess you never saw things my way anyway But I wonder when you're drinking if you Find yourself thinking about That boy from East Tennessee And I know we both knew better But we still said forever And that was seven summers Of Coke and Southern Comfort Were we dumb or just younger, who knows? Back then, you used to love the river And sippin' on a sixer with me Does it ever make you sad to know That was seven summers ago?  Ooh Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)  Yeah, I wonder when you're drinking if you Find yourself thinking about That boy from East Tennessee And I know we both knew better But we still said forever And that was seven summers Of Coke and Southern Comfort Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?

Before Him lowly bend! Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!

2070,Who Am I,HARDY,Country,"""I was born..""  A black man from the motherland Speakin a language today most people don't understand Where no one could bother me 'Cause I had freedom, justice, and equality But then one day it was tooken away And I was shipped to the U.S.A A young brother made into a slave To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins Given a new name, new religion No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa And all the blacks there now are just scavengers That's the way my mind was poisoned To believe that in America blacks are inferior A weak mind and a body of swine Only adds up to being - deaf, dumb and blind Illiterate to who where what and why So I ask myself: who am I? ""I was born..""  A native New Yorker on the streets Known for rockin rhymes to real rough beats That I found in the attic, noisy with static A sound that made me a Hip-Hop fanatic I made a few songs that sold OK Never top 20 or plenty airplay I came out hardcore, flexin cock diesel Saw a little cash and pop goes the weasel I had to make that change and rearrange My whole rap format, no hardcore rap So now all the pop charts I rule Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh I thought I made it, then my song faded And none of the black stations ever have played it I tried to blame it on MTV And say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC"" But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame Because I wanted the fame Money is not only the root of all evil It's also the destruction of black people, so Conjunction junction, what's your function? Being a scout or sellin out? Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye And say: who am I? A solid change, have to rearrange this strange Feelin I'm feelin, so appealin' I am having to deal with Time to forget the myth of bein black and a woman Can't get ahead, walkin on a thread, a tightrope Can't cope, don't be a dope, have a little bit of hope Runnin' your scope on affairs You have to be aware, don't flare up Let your cup runneth over I'm not Irish, don't need a donut to fill up my dish Nor two mango wish to wish on a star, they're so far Anyway I'm thinkin about today, not tomorrow I'm not a follower of anyone My time has come, it's already here My message is clear Like the women of long ago, I am also here Also to show, I have the courage Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity No matter the life, length of time Show me a sign, should I rely on a Subliminal message, should I question What would seem to be, life's told me?

2075,Rest in Peace,HARDY,Country,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today for this somber occasion. Please join us in the mourning of this U-47. It was a great microphone in its day until it met it's fate. One evening while it was in the studio It was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane. So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust, may this microphone, rest, in peace  Knock knock, guess who? Yes, ooh The Bigger the B, the Iggah the I, the Jigga the G is comin through Yes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin' bout To be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut The microphone assassinator and furthermore I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more So if you ask to give the Kane a go You better treat me like drugs, and Just Say No Because I utilize my skills to brutalize And in a battle, man, you should see what I do to guys Whenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme And come off, like dirty panties at nighttime Cause any mic that I caress, I finesse With zest, and just bless, best yet to progress King Asiatic, no other rapper stands this You couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles I gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit-eh Point blank, the kid's stri-daight Cause when it comes to R-A-P-P-I-N, huh I got it locked up like a bullpen ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest""  Rappers I get em and hit em and slit em and split em and rid em Acquit em, when I get with em, you can tell that I did em I take em and shake em and bake em and ache em and break em And rake em, you can't awake 'em from the comatose way I make 'em Cause when you're messin' with me, you know what? You can swallow a live grenade and you still won't blow up Pickin' up the microphone, you shouldn't dare It's like being on a Stairmaster, climbin' and goin' nowhere You're perpetratin' like you're ready and able But couldn't rock a show if the stage was a cradle Your rhymes are old as an artifact, and you don't want no part of that So don't even start it black Anyone riffin', I show them how I'm livin' And give them some of that treatment like my man Michael Bivins I smack em up, flip em and then shove em down Huh, oh I-ah-ah-I-ah-I-ah-I don't be fuckin' around To rip this microphone like this today Since eighty-seven I came a long, long way To headlinin', all the way from supportin' And I know you've been watchin' me Norton! Through my whole rap career, a lot of young, huh Rappers sat there, and listened, a lot of young, huh Rappers sat there, and wishin', but You couldn't see the Kane with X-Ray vision And just because you didn't see my crew for a few A lot of people thought the Wolfpack was through But if you think the Kane and Scoob and Scrap'll breakup I tell you like Marvin Gaye, ""Wake up, wake up, wake up"" Put it to rest, it's best to 'fess Because the Kane is breakin' rappers like the IRS And consider this microphone the deceased Now may it rest in peace ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""May you rest in peace"" ""If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

2173,Where Corn Don’t Grow,Riley Green,Country,"As we sat on the front porch Of that old grey house where I was born and raised Staring at the dusty fields Where my daddy worked hard everyday I think it kinda hurt him when I said ""Daddy there's a lot that I don't know But don't you ever dream about a life Where corn don't grow?"" He just sat there silent Staring at his favorite coffee cup I saw a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes When he looked up He said ""son I know at your age It seems like this ole world is turnin' slow And you think you'll find the answer to it all Wherе corn don't grow?""  Hard times are real Thеre's dusty fields no matter where you go You may change your mind Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow  I remember feeling guilty When Daddy turned and walked back in the house I was only 17 back then But I thought that I knew more than I know now I can't say he didn't warn me This city life's a hard row to hoe Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around Where corn don't grow Hard times are real There's dusty fields no matter where you go You may change your mind Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow  You may change your mind Oh, the weeds are high where corn don't growEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Or am I really seeing what I think I see? The woman of my dreams coming back to me  She went way up yonder past the caution light Don't know why, but something felt right When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell For some of her sweet tea Mama gave her a big old glass And sent her right back here to me  Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
