Billy Joel,Rock,"In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep From the mountains of faith To a river so deep I must be looking for something Something sacred I lost But the river is wide And it's too hard to cross  And even though I know The river is wide I walk down every evening And I stand on the shore And try to cross to the opposite side So I can finally find What I've been looking for  In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the valley of fear To a river so deep And I've been searching for something Taken out of my soul Something I would never lose Something somebody stole I don't know why I go walking at night But now I'm tired and I don't Want to walk anymore I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life Until I find what it is That I've been looking for  In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the jungle of doubt To a river so deep I know I'm searching for something Something so undefined That it can only be seen By the eyes of the blind In the middle of the night  I'm not sure about a life after this God knows I've never Been a spiritual man Baptized by the fire I wade into the river That runs to the promised land In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep Through the desert of truth To the river so deep We all end in the ocean We all start in the streams We're all carried along By the river of dreams  In the middle of the night (Gloria, it's not Marie...)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Billy Joel,Rock,"They say that these are not the best of times But they're the only times I've ever known And I believe there is a time for meditation In cathedrals of our own Now I have seen that sad Surrender in my lover's eyes And I can only stand apart and sympathize For we are always What our situations hand us It's either sadness or euphoria  So we'll argue and we'll compromise And realize that nothing's ever changed For all our mutual experience Our separate conclusions are the same Now we are forced To recognize our inhumanity Our reason coexists with our insanity And though we choose Between reality and madness It's either sadness or euphoria  How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies Perhaps we don't fulfill each others fantasies And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives With our respective similarities It's either sadness or euphoria Whoa, whoa3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Bob Dylan,Rock,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall She sees the bartender in a pool of blood Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”  Here comes the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world  Three bodies lyin' there Does Patty see And another man named Bello Moving around mysteriously “I didn’t do it,” he says And he throws up his hands “I was only robbin' the register I hope you understand  I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops “One of us had better call up the cops” And so Patty calls the cops And they arrive on the scene With their red lights flashin' In the hot New Jersey night Meanwhile, far away in another part of town Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around Number one contender for the middleweight crown Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down  When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road Just like the time before and the time before that In Paterson that’s just the way things go If you’re black You might as well not show up on the street Unless you want to draw the heat  Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around He said, “I saw two men running out They looked like middleweights They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”  And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead” So they took him to the infirmary And though this man could hardly see They told him that he could identify the guilty men Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye Says, “Why did you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!”  Here’s the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world  Four months later, the ghettos are in flame Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game And the cops are putting the screws to him Lookin' for somebody to blame  “Remember that murder that happened in a bar?” “Remember you said you saw the getaway car?” “You think you’d like to play ball with the law?” “Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw Running that night?” “Don’t forget that you are white” Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure” The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break We got you for the motel job And we’re talking to your friend Bello Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail Be a nice fellow  You’ll be doing society a favor That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver We want to put his ass in stir We want to pin this triple murder On him He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”  Rubin could take a man out with just one punch But he never did like to talk about it all that much ""It’s my work"", he’d say, ""and I do it for pay And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way""  Up to some paradise Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice And ride a horse along a trail But then they took him to the jailhouse Where they try to turn a man Into a mouse  All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance The trial was a pig-circus He never had a chance The judge made Rubin’s witnesses Drunkards from the slums To the white folks who watched He was a revolutionary bum  And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga No one doubted that he pulled the trigger And though they could not produce the gun The D.A. said he was the one Who did the deed And the all-white jury agreed  Rubin Carter was falsely tried The crime was murder “one,” Guess who testified? Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride  How can the life of such a man Be in the palm of some fool’s hand? To see him obviously framed Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed To live in a land Where justice is a game  Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties Are free to drink Martinis And watch the sun rise While Rubin sits like Buddha In a ten-foot cell An innocent man in a living hell  Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane But it won’t be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he’s done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Bob Dylan,Rock,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? And where have you been, my darling young one? I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall  Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? And what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? And what did you hear, my darling young one? I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall  Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son? And who did you meet, my darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman, her body was burning I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded in hatred  And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son? And what will you do now, my darling young one? I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison And the executioner’s face is always well hidden Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking But I’ll know my song well before I start singing  And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces Of my shoe Tangled up in blue She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said ""You look like the silent type"" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul From me to you Tangled up in blue  I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on Like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue So now I'm going back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know They're an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter's wives Don't know how it all got started I don't know what they're doing with their lives But me, I'm still on the road A-heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point Of view Tangled up in blue23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Bob Dylan,Rock,"Darkness at the break of noon Shadows even the silver spoon The handmade blade, the child's balloon Eclipses both the sun and moon To understand you know too soon There is no sense in trying  Pointed threats they bluff with scorn Suicide remarks are torn From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn Plays wasted words, proves to warn That he not busy being born Is busy dying  Temptation's page flies out the door You follow, find yourself at war Watch waterfalls of pity roar You feel to moan, but unlike before You discover that you'd just be one more Person crying  So don't fear if you hear A foreign sound to your ear It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing As some warn victory, some downfall Private reasons, great or small Can be seen in the eyes of those that call To make all that should be killed to crawl While others say don't hate nothing at all Except hatred  Disillusioned words like bullets bark As human gods aim for their mark Make everything from toy guns that spark To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark It's easy to see without lookin' too far That not much is really sacred  While preachers preach of evil fates Teachers teach that knowledge waits Can lead to hundred-dollar plates Goodness hides behind its gates But even the President of the United States Sometimes must have to stand naked  And though the rules of the road have been lodged It's only people's games that you got to dodge And it's alright, Ma, I can make it Advertising signs that con You into thinking you're the one That can do what's never been done That can win what's never been won Meantime, life outside goes on All around you  You lose yourself, you reappear You suddenly find you got nothing to fear Alone you stand with nobody near When a trembling distant voice, unclear Startles your sleeping ears to hear That somebody thinks they really found you  A question in your nerves is lit Yet you know there is no answer fit To satisfy, ensure you not to quit To keep it in your mind and not forget That it is not he, or she, or them, or it That you belong to  But though the masters make the rules For the wise men and the fools I got nothing, Ma, to live up to For them that must obey authority That they do not respect in any degree Who despise their jobs, their destiny Speak jealously of them that are free Do what they do just to be Nothing more than something they invest in  While some on principles baptized To strict party platform ties Social clubs in drag disguise Outsiders they can freely criticize Tell nothing except who to idolize And say ""God bless him""  While one who sings with his tongue on fire Gargles in the rat race choir Bent out of shape from society's pliers Cares not to come up any higher But rather get you down in the hole That he's in  But I mean no harm, nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him  Old lady judges watch people in pairs Limited in sex, they dare To push fake morals, insult and stare While money doesn't talk, it swears Obscenity, who really cares Propaganda, all is phony  While them that defend what they cannot see With a killer's pride, security It blows the minds most bitterly For them that think death's honesty Won't fall upon 'em naturally Life sometimes must get lonely  My eyes collide head-on with stuffed Graveyards, false goals, I scuff At pettiness which plays so rough Walk upside down inside handcuffs Kick my legs to crash it off Say, okay, I've had enough What else can you show me?  And if my thought-dreams could be seen They'd probably put my head in a guillotine But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan,Rock,"You must leave now Take what you need, you think will last But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast Yonder stands your orphan with his gun Crying like a fire in the sun  Look out, the saints are coming through And it's all over now, Baby Blue  The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense Take what you have gathered from coincidence The empty handed painter from your streets Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  The sky, too, is folding under you And it's all over now, Baby Blue  All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home Your empty-handed armies are all going home Your lover who just walked out the door Has taken all his blankets from the floor The carpet, too, is moving under you And it's all over now, Baby Blue  Leave your stepping stones behind There's something that calls for you Forget the dead you've left They will not follow you The vagabond who's rapping at your door Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  Strike another match, go start anew And it's all over now, Baby Blue13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan,Rock,"Ain't it just like the night to play Tricks when you're trying to be so quiet? We sit here stranded Though we're all doing our best to deny it And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it Lights flicker from the opposite loft In this room the heat pipes just cough The country music station plays soft But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off Just Louise and her lover so entwined And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind  In the empty lot where the ladies play Blindman's bluff with the key chain And the all-night girls They whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane Louise, she's all right, she's just near She's delicate and seems like the mirror But she just makes it all too concise and too clear That Johanna's not here The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously And when bringing her name up He speaks of a farewell kiss to me He's sure got a lotta gall To be so useless and all Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn  Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while"" But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze When the jelly-faced women all sneeze Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees"" Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel  The peddler now speaks To the countess who's pretending to care for him Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite And I'll go out and say a prayer for him"" But like Louise always says ""You can't look at much, can you, man?"" As she, herself, prepares for him And Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes everything's been returned which was owed On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Scott Fitzgerald's books You are very well read It's well known But something is happening here But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you And then he kneels He crosses himself And then he clicks his high heels And without further notice He asks you how it feels And he says, ""Here is your throat back Thanks for the loan""  And something is happening here But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  Now you see this one-eyed midget Shouting the word ""Now"" And you say, ""For what reason?"" And he says, ""How?"" And you say, ""What does this mean?"" And he screams back ""You're a cow Give me some milk or else go home"" And you know something is happening here But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?  Well, you walk into the room Like a camel and then you frown You put your eyes in your pocket And your nose on the ground There oughtta be a law Against you comin' around You should be made To wear earphones  'Cause something is happening here But ya' don't know what it is Do you, Mister Jones?14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan,Rock,"The pale moon rose in its glory Out o'er the Western town She told a sad, sad story Of the great ship that went down  T'was the fourteenth day of April Over the waves she rode Sailing into tomorrow To a gilded age foretold  The night was black with starlight The seas were sharp and clear Moving through the shadows The promised hour was near  Lights were holding steady Gliding over the foam All the lords and ladies Heading for their eternal home  The chandeliers were swaying From the balustrades above The orchestra was playing Songs of faded love The watchman, he lay dreaming As the ballroom dancers twirled He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the underworld  Leo took his sketchbook He was often so inclined He closed his eyes and painted The scenery in his mind  Cupid struck his bosom And broke it with a snap The closest woman to him He fell into her lap  He heard a loud commotion Something sounded wrong His inner spirit was saying That he couldn't stand here long  He staggered to the quarterdeck No time now to sleep Water on the quarterdeck Already three foot deep Smokestack was leaning sideways Heavy feet began to pound He walked into the whirlwind Sky splitting all around  The ship was going under The universe had opened wide The roll was called up yonder The angels turned aside  Lights down in the hallway Flickering dim and dull Dead bodies already floating In the double bottom hull  The engines then exploded Propellers they failed to start The boilers overloaded The ship's bow split apart  Passengers were flying Backward, forward, far and fast They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled Each one more weary than the last The veil was torn asunder 'Tween the hours of twelve and one No change, no sudden wonder Could undo what had been done  The watchman lay there dreaming At forty-five degrees He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking Dropping to her knees  Wellington he was sleeping His bed began to slide His valiant heart was beating He pushed the tables aside  Glass of shattered crystal Lay scattered roundabout He strapped on both his pistols How long could he hold out?  His men and his companions Were nowhere to be seen In silence there he waited for Time and space to intervene  The passageway was narrow There was blackness in the air He saw every kind of sorrow Heard voices everywhere  Alarm-bells were ringing To hold back the swelling tide Friends and lovers clinging To each other side by side  Mothers and their daughters Descending down the stairs Jumped into the icy waters Love and pity sent their prayers  The rich man, Mister Astor Kissed his darling wife He had no way of knowing Be the last trip of his life  Calvin, Blake, and Wilson Gambled in the dark Not one of them would ever live to Tell the tale or disembark  Brother rose up 'gainst brother In every circumstance They fought and slaughtered each other In a deadly dance  They lowered down the lifeboats From the sinking wreck There were traitors, there were turncoats Broken backs and broken necks  The bishop left his cabin To help all those in need Turned his eyes up to the heavens Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""  Davey the brothel-keeper Came out dismissed his girls Saw the water getting deeper Saw the changing of his world  Jim Backus smiled He never learned to swim Saw the little crippled child And he gave his seat to him  He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the East Death was on the rampage But his heart was now at peace  They battened down the hatches But the hatches wouldn't hold They drowned upon the staircase Of brass and polished gold  Leo said to Cleo I think I'm going mad But he'd lost his mind already Whatever mind he had  He tried to block the doorway To save all those from harm Blood from an open wound Pouring down his arm  Petals fell from flowers Tell all of them were gone In the long and dreadful hours The wizard's curse played on  The host was pouring brandy He was going down slow He stayed right to the end and he Was the last to go  There were many, many others Nameless here forever more They never sailed the ocean Or left their homes before  The watchman, he lay dreaming The damage had been done He dreamed the Titanic was sinking And he tried to tell someone  The captain, barely breathing Kneeling at the wheel Above him and beneath him Fifty thousand tons of steel  He looked over at his compass And he gazed into its face Needle pointing downward He knew he lost the race  In the dark illumination He remembered bygone years He read the Book of Revelation And he filled his cup with tears  When the Reaper's task had ended Sixteen hundred had gone to rest The good, the bad, the rich, the poor The loveliest and the best  They waited at the landing And they tried to understand But there is no understanding For the judgment of God's hand  The news came over the wires And struck with deadly force The love had lost its fires All things had run their course  The watchman he lay dreaming Of all the things that can be He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the deep blue sea3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Bob Dylan,Rock,"My love she speaks like silence Without ideals or violence She doesn't have to say she's faithful Yet she's true, like ice, like fire  People carry roses And make promises by the hours My love she laughs like the flowers Valentines can't buy her  In the dime stores and bus stations People talk of situations Read books, repeat quotations Draw conclusions on the wall  Some speak of the future My love she speaks softly She knows there's no success like failure And that failure's no success at all  The cloak and dagger dangles Madams light the candles In ceremonies of the horsemen Even a pawn must hold a grudge Statues made of match sticks Crumble into one another My love winks, she does not bother She knows too much to argue or to judge  The bridge at midnight trembles The country doctor rambles Bankers' nieces seek perfection Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring  The wind howls like a hammer The night blows rainy My love she's like some raven At my window with a broken wing3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan,Rock,"One time ago a crazy dream came to me I dreamt I was walking to World War Three I went to the doctor the very next day To see what kind of words he could say He said it was a bad dream ""I wouldn’t worry about it none, though Them old dreams are only in your head""  I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain” He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane” He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!” As I landed on the psychiatric couch He said “Tell me about it”  Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast It was all over by a quarter past I was down in the sewer with some little lover When I peeked out from a manhole cover Wondering who turned the lights on us  Well, I got up and I walked around Up and down the lonesome town I stood a-wondering which way to go I lit a cigarette on a parking meter And walked on down the road It was a normal day Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell And I leaned my head and I give a yell “Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man” A shotgun fired, and away I ran I don’t blame him too much though, he didn't know me  Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand I seen a man I said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two” He screamed a bit, and away he flew Thought I was a Communist  Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave I said “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve” I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something? You seen what happened last time they started”  Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown There was nobody around I got into the driver’s seat And I drove down 42nd Street In my Cadillac Good car to drive after a war Well, I remember seeing some ad So I turned on my Conelrad But I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill So the radio didn’t work so well Turned on my record player — It was Rock-a-day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa Our Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”  I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue I needed somebody to talk to So I called up the operator of time Just to hear a voice of some kind “When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock” She said that for over an hour And I hung up  Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then Saying “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams But mine was a little different, you see I dreamt the only person left after the war was me I didn’t see you around""  Well, now time passed and now it seems Everybody’s having them dreams Everybody sees their self Walking around with no one else ""Half of the people can be part right all of the time And some of the people can be all right part of the time But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time"" I think Abraham Lincoln said that “I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours” I said that10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan,Rock,"I’ve seen love go by my door It’s never been this close before Never been so easy or so slow I've been shooting in the dark too long When something’s not right, it’s wrong You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  Dragon clouds so high above I’ve only known careless love It always just hit me from below But this time 'round it’s more correct Right on target, so direct You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace Crimson hair across your face You could make me cry, if you don’t know Can’t remember what I was thinking of You might be spoilin’ me too much, love You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme Blue river running slow and lazy I could stay with you forever and never realize the time Situations have ended sad Relationships have all been bad Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud But there’s no way I can compare All them scenes to this affair You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’ Staying far behind without you You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’ You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to  I’ll look for you in old Honolulu San Francisco or Ashtabula You're gonna have to leave me now, I know But I’ll see you in the sky above In the tall grass, in the ones I love You're gonna make me lonesome when you go7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

""Something hidden down below the level of your conversation?"" Well he turned away before the answer Though I yelled aloud he refused to hear It became to clear So it went as we put out I was left in constant doubt Everything I asked about seemed private The captain strolled the bridge one night I stopped him in the evening light To ask him would it be all right to join him But he stood there like some idol And he listened like some temple And then he turned away All along the fateful coast We moved silent like a ghost The timeless sea of tireless host possessed us The wind came building from the cold northwest And soon the waves began to crest Crashing cross the forward deck All hands lost I alone survived the sinking I alone possessed the tools On that ship of foolsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Bruce Springsteen,Rock,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick And steer as we drove through town He'd tousle my hair and say ""Son, take a good look around This is your hometown."" This is your hometown This is your hometown This is your hometown In '65 tension was running high at my high school There was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white There was nothing you could do Two cars at a light on a Saturday night In the back seat there was a gun Words were passed, then a shotgun blast Troubled times had come to my hometown To my hometown To my hometown To my hometown Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks Foreman says ""These jobs are going, boys And they ain't coming back To your hometown."" To your hometown To your hometown To your hometown Last night me and Kate, we laid in bed Talking about getting out Packing up our bags maybe heading south I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now Last night I sat him up behind the wheel, and said ""Son take a good look around This is your hometown.""

Eagles,Rock,"Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café  Oh, expecting to fly We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by  Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away And some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café {Acoustic Solo}  The clouds rolled in and hid that shore Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be I don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all No use in asking why, it just turned out that way So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café {Saxophone Solo}3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

""Give me another piece of that pecan pie!"" Freeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune We're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon Captains of the old order clinging to the reins Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains  But it's a long road out of Eden  Back home I was so certain The path was very clear But now I have to wonder What are we doing here? I'm not counting on tomorrow And I can't tell wrong from right But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight   Weaving down the American highway Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda And now we're driving dazed and drunk Been down the road to Damascus The road to Mandalay Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way He said, ""It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste"" ""But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste"" Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools  And it's a long road out of Eden2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Elton John,Rock,"As I awoke this evening With the smell of woodsmoke clinging Like a gentle cobweb hanging Upon a painted tepee Oh, I went to see my chieftain With my warlance and my woman For he told us that the yellow moon Would very soon be leaving This I can't believe I said I can't believe our Warlord's dead Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns Oh, great father of the Iroquois Ever since I was young I've read the writing of the smoke And breast-fed on the sound of drums I've learned to hurl the tomahawk And ride a painted pony wild To run the gauntlet of the Sioux To make a chieftain's daughter mine And now you ask that I should watch The red man's race be slowly crushed? What kind of words are these to hear From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears? I take only what is mine, Lord My pony, my squaw, and my child I can't stay to see you die Along with my tribe's pride I go to search for the yellow moon And the fathers of our sons Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold And the healing waters run Trampling down the prairie rose Leaving hoof tracks in the sand Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead He'd been laying down his weapons When they filled him full of lead Now there seems no reason why I should carry on In this land that once was my land I can't find a home It's lonely and it's quiet And the horse soldiers are coming And I think it's time I strung my bow And ceased my senseless running For soon I'll find the yellow moon Along with my loved ones Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields Without the sound of guns And the red sun sinks at last Into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior Comes with a bullet hole1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Frank Zappa,Rock,"After a few weeks on the bus, being porked by Toad-O's road crew, and being too exhausted to do their laundry on a regular basis, MARY is dumped in Miami. With no money (and no other famous rock groups due into the area for at least three weeks), she tries to pick up a few bucks by entering the Wet T-Shirt contest at The Brasserie..  Looks to me like something funny Is going on around here People laughin' 'n dancin' 'n payin' Entirely too much for their beer  And they all think they are clean outta-site And they're ready to party cause the sign outside says it's Wet T-Shirt Nite And they all crave some hot delight  Well the girls are excited because in a minute They're gonna get wet And the boys are delighted because all the titties Will get 'em upset  And they all think they're reety-alright And they're ready to boogie cause the sign outside says it's Wet T-Shirt Nite 'N they all crave some pink delight When the water gets on 'em their ninnies get rigid 'N look pretty bold It's a common reaction that makes an attraction Whenever it's cold  An' all of the fellas they wish they could bite On the cute little nuggets The local girls are showin' off tonight You know I think it serves 'em right You know I think it serves 'em right You know I think it serves 'em right You know I think it serves 'em right And it's Wet T-Shirt Time again! I know you want someone to show you some tit! Big ones! Wet ones! Big wet ones!  At this point, FATHER RILEY (who had been recently de-frocked for not meeting his quota, and has grown his hair out and bought a groovy sport coot and moved to Miami and changed his name to BUDDY JONES) steps onto the crowded bandstand in his exciting new role as a WET T-SHIRT CONTEST EMCEE...  Ah, thanks, Ike Yes, it's Wet T-Shirt Time again Here at The Brasserie, home of the tits... huh huh And it's the charming Mary from Canoga Park Up next in her bid for the semi-finals Hi, Mary... how'ya doin'? (Having been fucked senseless by the boys in the crew, MARY does not recognize the former religious personage from her nights in the rectory basement during which she acquired her basic manual skills. Confounded by his sport coat, she replies..) Hi! (Realizing that she no longer recognizes him... or even appreciates the patient religious training he had given her in the past, BUDDY JONES, like a true WET T-SHIRT EMCEE type person, proceeds to say various stupid things to waste time, making the contest itself take longer, thereby giving the mongoloids squatting on the dance floor an opportunity to buy more exciting beverages. . . liquid products that will expand their consciousnesses to the point whereby they might more fully enjoy the ambiance of Miami By Night...) Where ya from? Ah, the bus Which one? You know... the last tour You know...

Frank Zappa,Rock,"But one night, at the Social Club meeting Mary didn't show up She was sucking cock backstage at The Armory In order to get a pass To see some big rock group for free  Backstage at the local Armory, MARY, in her little white dress, is wiping the remnants of her performance off the side of her mouth as LARRY (the guy from the garage who quit the band in order to make an honest living) zips up the front of his stinking boiler suit and sings to the same teen-age girls who were stomping and clapping a little while ago, as they kneel with their little pink mouths open near the crew bus, hoping to save the price of admission by performing acts of Hooverism on the jolly lads who set up the P. A. System  Hey, hey, hey all you girls in these industrial towns I know you're prob'ly gettin' tired of all the local clowns They never give you no respect, they never treat you nice So perhaps you oughta' try a little friendly advice  And be a crew slut Hey, you'll love it Be a crew slut It's a way of life Be a crew slut See the world Don't make a fuss, just get on the bus Crew slut Add water, makes its own sauce Be a crew slut So you don't forget, call before midnite tonite The boys in the crew are just waiting for you You never get to move around, you never go nowhere I know yer prob'ly gettin' tired of all the guys out there You always wondered what it's like to go from place to place So, darlin', take a little ride on the mixer's face  And be a crew slut Just follow the magic footprints Be a crew slut Hey, you'll love it! Be a crew slut It's a way of life I ain't gonna squash it and you don't need to wash it! Crew slut Hey, I'll buy you a pizza Be a crew slut Of course I'll introduce you to Warren The boys in the crew are only waiting for you  At this point, the road crew, as all road crews must from time to time, borrow some of the big rock group's equipment and have a blues jam session, indicating to the kneeling maidens that they are endowed with a great deal of raw talent, as well as massive meat. Obviously impressed with LARRY'S ability to suck so hard on his harmonica that screeching little noises come out of it, MARY kneels again and reaches upward in gestures of supplication, listening intently as LARRY continues to sing..   Well you been to Alabama, girl, 'n Georgia too And all the boys in the crew is bein' good to you I know you're sayin' to yourself ""This is the way to go"" Cause when you need a little extra they will give you some mo' Cause you're the crew slut I'm into leather That's good! Crew slut A lot of the boys in the crew love leather And rubber? Crew slut Yeah, they like rubber too... shrink-tubing with a hair dryer Trade your spot on the bench for a guy with a wrench And be a crew slut Ha ha ha You like that, huh? Crew slut I told you you'd love it It's a way of life! The guys in the crew Have got a present for you! A present for me? We got a present for you! Whaddya got? Whaddya gonna give me? It looks just like a Telefunken U-47 You'll love it With leather? Eh errr, eh eh... This is the Central Scrutinizer, again And so Mary was enticed away from Joe By an evil barbarian with a wrench in his pocket Lured into a life of sleazery....

It is my responsibility to enforce all the laws That haven't been passed yet It is also my responsibility to alert each and every one of you To the potential consequences Of various ordinary everyday activities You might be performing which could eventually lead to The death penalty - or affect your parents' credit rating... Our criminal institutions are full of little creeps like you Who do wrong things And many of them were driven to these crimes By a horrible force called MUSIC! Our studies have shown that this horrible force Is so dangerous to society at large That laws are being drawn up at this very moment To stop it - forever! Cruel and inhuman punishments are being carefully described In tiny paragraphs So they won't conflict with the Constitution... Which, itself, is being modified in order to accommodate The future!

You'll love it, it's a way of life, that's right You'll love it, a way of life, right, love it... This is the Central Scrutinizer... [Desperate nerds in high offices all over the world have been known to enact the most disgusting pieces of legislation in order to win votes (or, in places where they don't get to vote, to control unwanted forms of mass behavior) Environmental laws were not passed to protect our air and water... they were passed to get votes. Seasonal anti-smut campaigns are not conducted to rid our communities of moral rot...they are conducted to give an aura of saintliness to the office-seekers who demand them. If a few key phrases are thrown into any speech (as the expert advisors explain to these various heads of state) votes will roll in, bucks will roll in, and, most importantly, power will be maintained by the groovy guy (or gal) who gets the most media coverage for his sleaze. Naturally, his friends in various businesses will do okay too All governments perpetuate themselves through the daily commission of act which a rational person might find to be stupid or dangerous (or both). Naturally, our government is no exception... for instance, if the President (any one of them) went on TV and sat there with the flag in the background (or maybe a rustic scene on a little backdrop, plus the flag) and stared sincerely into the camera and told everybody that all energy problems and all inflationary problems had been traced to and could be solved by the abolition of music, chances are that most people would believe him and think that the illegalization of this obnoxious form of noise pollution would be a small price to pay for the chance to buy gas like the good ol' days. No way? Never happen? Records are made out of oil. All those big rock shows go from town to town in fuel-gobbling 45 foot trucks...and when they get there, they use up enormous amounts of electrical energy with their lights, their amplifiers, their PA systems...their smoke machines. And all those synthesizers...look at all the plastic they got in 'em...and the guitar picks...you name it... Joe’s Garage is a stupid story about how the government is going to try to do away with music (a prime cause of unwanted mass behavior)! It's sort of like a really cheap kind of high school play...the way it might have been done 20 years ago, with all the sets made out of cardboard boxes and poster paint. It's also like those lectures that local narks used to give (where they show you a display of all the different ways you can get wasted, with the pills leading to the weed leading to the needle, etc., etc.). If the plot of the story seems just a little bit preposterous, and if the idea of The Central Scrutinizer enforcing laws that haven't been passed yet makes you giggle, just be glad you don't live in one of the cheerful little countries where, at this very moment, music is either severely restricted...or, as it is in Iran, totally illegal.]2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Frank Zappa,Rock,"Arriving at L. Ron Hoover's modernistic office / cathedral / ware-house / condominium complex, Joe is greeted by a pre-recorded message and a dramatically illuminated image on a wall-sized TV screen  Welcome to the First Church of Appliantology! The White Zone is for loading and unloading only!  Don't you be tarot-fied It's just a token of my extreme Don't you be tarot-fied It's just a token of my extreme Don't you never try to look behind my eyes You don't wanna know what they have seen Don't you never try to look behind my eyes You don't wanna know what they have seen  Some people think That if they go too far They'll never get back To where the rest of them are I might be crazy But there's one thing I know You might be surprised At what you find out when ya go! And thus, having rationalized his expedition to L. Ron's modernistic office / cathedral / warehouse / condominium complex, JOE seeks the answer to his problem  Oh, oh, oh, Mystical Advisor What is my problem, tell me, can you see? Well, you have nothing to fear, my son! You are a Latent Appliance Fetishist, it appears to me! That all seems very, very strange I never craved a toaster or a color T.V A Latent Appliance Fetishist Is a person who refuses to admit to his or herself That sexual gratification can only be achieved Through the use of machines! Get the picture?  Are you telling me I should come out of the closet now, Mr. Ron? No, my son! You must go into The Closet! What? And you will have Eh? Hey! A lot of fun! That's where they all live So if you want an appliance to love you You'll have to go in there and get you one Well, that seems simple enough! Yes, but if you want a really good one You'll have to learn a foreign language! German, for instance? That's right A lot of really cute ones come from over there! Fifty bucks, please! And a cheerful group of Appliantologists dance into the room wearing aluminum foil lab smocks, lock arms in a circle around JOE, making sure he pays in full, all the while singing with L. RON as he delivers his final instructions  If you've been modified It's an illusion, and you're in between Don't you be tarot-fied It's just a lot of nothin' so what can it mean? If you've been modified It's an illusion, and you're in between Don't you be tarot-fied It's just a lot of nothin' so what can it mean? If you've been modified It's an illusion, and you're in between  This is the Central Scrutinizer... Joe has just learned to speak German Now, get this, here's why he did it! He's gonna go to this club on the other side of town It's called The Closet... And they got these Appliances in there that really go for a guy Dressed up like a housewife who can speak German (you know what I mean) ...so Joe's learned how to speak German He goes in this place and he sees these little Kitchen Machineries Dancing around with each other, and he sees this one... That looks like it's a cross between an industrial vacuum cleaner And a chrome piggy bank with marital aids stuck all over its body... It's really exciting... and when he sees it, he bursts into song...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

We are dumb all over Dumb all over, yes we are Dumb all over, near an' far Dumb all over, black an' white People, we is not wrapped tight Nerds on the left, nerds on the right Religious fanatics on the air every night Saying the Bible tells the story Makes the details sound real gory About what to do if the geeks over there Don't believe in the book we got over here You can't run a race without no feet An' pretty soon there won't be no street For dummies to jog on or doggies to dog on Religious fanatics can make it be all gone It won't blow up an' disappear It'll just look ugly for a thousand years...

Genesis,Rock,"Part I: ""Lover's Leap"" (0:00 - 3:47) Walking across the sitting room I turn the television off Sitting beside you I look into your eyes As the sound of motor cars Fades in the nighttime I swear I saw your face change It didn't seem quite right  And it's, ""Hello babe With your guardian eyes so blue Hey my baby, don't you know Our love is true?""  Coming closer with our eyes A distance falls around our bodies Out in the garden The moon seems very bright Six saintly shrouded men Move across the lawn slowly The seventh walks in front With a cross held high in hand And it's, ""Hey babe Your supper's waiting for you Hey my baby, don't you know Our love is true?""  I've been so far from here Far from your warm arms It's good to feel you again It's been a long, long time  Hasn't it? Part II: ""The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man"" (3:48 - 5:41) I know a farmer who looks after the farm With water clear, he cares for all his harvest I know a fireman who looks after the fire  You, can't you see he's fooled you all? Yes, he's here again Can't you see he's fooled you all Share his peace, sign the lease He's a supersonic scientist He's a guaranteed eternal sanctuary man ""Look, look into my mouth,"" he cries ""And all the children lost down many paths I bet my life you'll walk inside"" Hand in hand, gland in gland With a spoonful of miracle He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary  (We will rock you, rock you little snake) (We will keep you snug and warm) Part III: ""Ikhnaton And Itsacon And Their Band Of Merry Men"" (5:42 - 9:42) Wearing feelings on our faces While our faces took a rest We walked across the fields To see the children of the West But we saw a host of dark-skinned warriors Standing still below the ground Waiting for battle!  Fight's begun, they've been released Killing foe for peace Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang And they're giving me a wonderful potion 'Cause I cannot contain my emotion And even though I'm feeling good Something tells me I'd better activate My prayer capsule  Today is a day to celebrate The foe have met their fate The order for rejoicing and dancing Has come from our warlord Part IV: ""How Dare I Be So Beautiful?"" (9:43 - 11:04) Wandering in the chaos The battle has left We climb up the mountain Of human flesh To a plateau of green grass And green trees full of life  A young figure Sits still by a pool He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" By some butchery tool He is you  Social Security Took care of this lad We watch in reverence As Narcissus is turned to a flower  (A flower?) Part V: ""Willow Farm"" (11:05 - 15:34) If you go down to Willow Farm To look for butterflies Or flutter-byes or gutter-flies Open your eyes It's full of surprise, everyone lies Like the fox on the rocks And the musical box Oh, there's mum and dad And good and bad And everyone's happy to be here  There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag He used to be a British flag Plastic bag, what a drag The frog was a prince The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg The egg was a bird (Fly away you sweet little thing) (They're hard on your tail) Haven't you heard?

I've been so far from here Far from your loving arms Now I'm back again And babe, it's gonna work out fine Part VII: ""As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs (Aching Men's Feet)"" (20:47 - 23:06) Can't you feel our souls ignite? Shedding ever-changing colours In the darkness of the fading night Like the river joins the ocean As the germ in a seed grows We've finally been freed to get back home  There's an angel standing in the sun And he's crying with a loud voice ""This is the supper of the mighty one"" Lord of lords, king of kings Has returned to lead his children home To take them to the new Jerusalem5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

But he does not even want to try to speak I'm helpless in my violent rage And a silent tear of blood Dribbles down his cheek And I watch him turn again And leave the cage My little runaway (Raindrops keep falling on my head They keep falling on my...)  In a trap, feel a strap Holding still, pinned for kill Chances narrow that I'll make it In the cushioned straight jacket Just like 22nd Street When they got me by my neck and feet Pressure's building, can't take more My headaches charge, my earaches roar In this pain, get me out of this pain  If I could change to liquid I could fill the cracks up in the rock But I know that I am solid And I am my own bad luck But outside John disappears And my cage dissolves And without any reason My body revolves  Keep on turning Keep on turning Turning around Just spinning aroundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

See... onward she comes Onward she nears, out of the sun See, she has no crew She has no life, wait but there's two  Death and she Life-in-Death They throw their dice for the crew She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now Then... crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She... she, Life-in-Death She lets him live, her chosen one  ""One after one by the star-dogged Moon Too quick for groan or sigh Each turned his face with a ghastly pang And cursed me with his eye Four times fifty living men And I heard nor sigh nor groan With heavy thump, a lifeless lump They dropped down one by one.""

Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on Dreams live on, dreams live on, on   Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east The empire of the clouds may rest in peace And in a country churchyard laid head to the mast Eight and forty souls who came to die in France11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Help me Help me to find my true self without seeing the future Save me Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams, ow!

She must have been about forty, forty-five Kept telling about her husband cause he wasn't there He was always trying to get a private audience with the Maharishi And he kept refusing I knew only one thing: He must have had some of his own It must have been that little Indian piece She came with the tailor And could sit at his feet And that was one in five hundred The rest had to wait like good American people In lines to see the master walking on the petals Who lived in a million dollar staccato house overlooking the Himalayas He looked holy (But he was a sex maniac) I couldn't say that, but he certainly wasn't...

Neil Young,Rock,"I am a lonely visitor I came too late to cause a stir Though I campaigned all my life Towards that goal I hardly slept the night you wept Our secret's safe and still well kept  Where even Richard Nixon has got soul Even Richard Nixon has got soul  Traffic cops are all color blind People steal from their own kind Evening comes too early for a stroll Down neon streets the streaker streaks The speaker speaks but the truth still leaks  Where even Richard Nixon has got soul Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul  The podium rocks in the crowded waves The speaker talks of the beautiful saves That went down long before He played this role For the hotel queens and the magazines Test tube genes and slot machines Where even Richard Nixon has got soul Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul  Hospitals have made him cry But there's always a freeway in his eye Though his beach just got too crowded for a stroll Roads stretch out like healthy veins And wild gift horses strain the reins  Where even Richard Nixon has got soul Even Richard Nixon has got soul  I am a lonely visitor I came too late to cause a stir Though I campaigned all my life Towards that goal2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Go to a lake of fire and fry See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July  I knew a lady who came from Duluth Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth She went to her grave just a little too soon Flew away howling on the yellow moon  Where do bad folks go when they die? They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Go to a lake of fire and fry See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July  People cry and people moan Look for a dry place to call their home Try to find some place to rest their bones While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own  Where do bad folks go when they die? They don't go to heaven where the angels fly Go to a lake of fire and fry See 'em again 'til the Fourth of July 21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things...""

Home to change!  ""...I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last...""

You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this? You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. ""If God is our father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin."" Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color, and of course, those little people out there were yours too72EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Yes,Rock,"Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days undersearching every feeling Corridors of time provoking memories, disjointed but with purpose Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructor's sharp And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age, as the links span Our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting Talk to the sunlight caller Soft summer mover distance mine Called out a tune but I never saw the face Heard but not replaced I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day Lost in lights array I ventured to see, as the sound began to play What happened to this song we once knew so well Signed promise for moments caught within the spell I must have waited all my life for this Moment moment The future poised with the splendour just begun The light we were as one And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun And for a moment when our world had filled the skies Magic turned our eyes To feast on the treasure set for our strange device What happened to wonders we once knew so well Did we forget what happened surely we can tell We must have waited all our lives for this Moment moment moment Star light movements in seasons Release forward Tallest rainbow Sun shower seasons Life flower reasons They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe that I can feel it There's someone, to tell you Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you Getting over overhanging trees Let them rape the forest Thoughts would send our fusion Clearly to be home Getting over wars we do not mean Or so it seems so clearly Sheltered with our passion Clearly to be home They move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe they really mean to There's someone, to tell you And I just can't believe our song will leave you Skyline teacher Warland seeker Send out poison Cast iron leader And through the rhythm of moving slowly Sent through the rhythm work out the story Move over glory to sons of old fighters past Young Christians see it from the beginning Old people feel it that's what they're saying Move over glory to sons of old fighters past The move fast, they tell me But I just can't believe they really mean to There's someone, to tell you A course towards a universal season Getting over overhanging trees let them Rape the forest, they might stand and leave them Clearly to be home Getting over wars we do not mean We charm the movement suffers Call out all our memories Clearly to be home We've moved fast We need love A part we offer is our only freedom What happened to this song we once knew so well Signed promise for moments caught within the spell We must have waited all our lives for this Moment moment Past present movers moments we'll process the future, but only To touch him we know, send flowered rainbows That chased flowers of dark and lights of songs To you, show all we feel for and know of, cast round Youth is the truth accepting that reasons will relive And breathe hope and chase and love For you

me There's someone, rainbow, alternate tune In the days of summer so long We danced as evening sang their song We wander out the day so long And I do feel very well That the evenings take you silently
