Adele,Pop,"Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  There's such a difference between us And a million miles  Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside At least, I can say that I've tried To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened? It's no secret that the both of us Are running out of time  So hello from the other side (Other side) I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside (Outside) At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Ooh, anymore (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows) Anymore  Hello from the other side (Other side) I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem to be home Hello from the outside (Outside) At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried) To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore 252EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Adele,Pop,"There ain't no gold in this river That I've been washin' my hands in forever I know there is hope in these waters But I can't bring myself to swim When I am drowning in this silence Baby, let me in  Go easy on me, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me  There ain't no room for things to change When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways You can't deny how hard I have tried I changed who I was to put you both first But now I give up  Go easy on mе, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to Feel thе world around me Had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me I had good intentions And the highest hopes But I know right now It probably doesn't even show  Go easy on me, baby I was still a child I didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me I had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me127EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Adele,Pop,"I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light  I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over  Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead  You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over  Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead  Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?  Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead  Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you, too Don't forget me, I beg I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead214EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Adele,Pop,"Everybody loves the things you do From the way you talk to the way you move Everybody here is watching you 'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true But if by chance you're here alone Can I have a moment before I go? 'Cause I've been by myself all night long Hoping you're someone I used to know  You look like a movie You sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young  Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time that we might Be exactly like we were before we realised We were sad of getting old, it made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song  I was so scared to face my fears Nobody told me that you'd be here And I swear you'd moved overseas That's what you said when you left me You still look like a movie You still sound like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young  Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time that we might Be exactly like we were before we realised We were sad of getting old, it made us restless It was just like a movie It was just like a song  (When we were young) (When we were young) (When we were young) (When we were young)  It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back To when you were there, to when you were there And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone 'Cause I still care, do you still care? It was just like a movie It was just like a song My God, this reminds me Of when we were young  (When we were young) (When we were young) (When we were young) (When we were young)  Let me photograph you in this light In case it is the last time that we might Be exactly like we were before we realised We were sad of getting old, it made us restless Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless It was just like a movie It was just like a song When we were young89EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Adele,Pop,"I will leave my heart at the door I won't say a word They've all been said before, you know So why don't we just play pretend Like we're not scared of what is coming next Or scared of having nothing left?

Ed Sheeran,Pop,"Things were all good yesterday And then the devil took your memory And if you fell to your death today I hope that heaven is your resting place I heard the doctors put your chest in pain But then that could've been the medicine And now you're lying in the bed again Either way I'll cry with the rest of them  And my father told me ""son It's not his fault he doesn't know your face And you're not the only one"" Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing  Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we're wrapped in light and life and love Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut For they're designed to be together, oh With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one And we're set alight, we're afire love Oh love And things were all good yesterday But then the devil took your breath away And now we're left here in the pain Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain And now my family is one again Stapled together with the strangers and a friend Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen Six years old, I remember when  And my father told me ""son It's not his fault he doesn't know your face And you're not the only one"" Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing  Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up And we're wrapped in light and life and love Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut For they're designed to be together, oh With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one And we're set alight, we're afire love Oh love And my father and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And my brother and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And my brother and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah And all my brother and my sisters And my father and all of my family Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah91EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed Sheeran,Pop,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor The only evidence that you've been here before And I don't get waves of missing you anymore They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry, so I get high Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on Weeks pass in the blink of an eye And I'm still drunk at the end of the night I don't drink like everybody else I do it to forget things about myself Stumble and fall with head spin I've got My mind's with you but my heart's just not  So am I close to you anymore if it's over And there's no chance that we'll work it out?  That's why you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that I never wanna settle down, come around Break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another ""like you"" Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views Everything’s great, not everything’s sure But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus Now I'm in position to be another stalker Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous On the surface And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it Pain is only relevant if it still hurts I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  So am I close to you anymore if it's over And there's no chance that we'll work it out?  Oh, you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied Because, if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh) And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered From all that I've done wrong And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one But I know God made another one of me To love you better than I ever will  'Cause you and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied You and I Ended over U-N-I And I said that's fine But you're the only one that knows I lied45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed Sheeran,Pop,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I'll do my own thing now and get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked And went from sleeping at a subway station To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on"" I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong But then I've never had an enemy except the NME But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now  Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No, I'll take it back now Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect 'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state Vividly, need to let my liver be And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but But I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made And every single second knowing that we'll never betray The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love No  My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 percent of it when we wake But the other 10 percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow Igh!58EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can’t help it I put my job over everything except my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day we'll have to say it again  Oh Nina You should go, Nina Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina Oh, won't you leave me now?

So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart on the radio beat They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us Back to the time you were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew Everything led back to you So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? You're the song my heart is beating to So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And oh, I know And oh, I know And oh I can see the stars From America58EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change  Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore51EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Katy Perry,Pop,"""You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you’re the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you’re fine when you’re not really fine, but you just can’t get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like ‘Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'""4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Even my phone misses your call, by the way  Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too But you, you never do Woke up the girl who looked just like you I almost said your name We haven't spoke since you went away Comfortable silence is so overrated Why won't you ever say what you want to say? Even my phone misses your call We haven't spoke since you went away Comfortable silence is so overrated Why won't you ever say what you want to say?

Harry Styles,Pop,"Hello, I’m Harry Styles, and tonight I’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music. A sleep story just for you. With all the business of your day, I know how hard it can be to go to sleep. So, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you. I wish you a wonderful night sleep. So make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out. In, and then out. And when you’re ready, close your eyes Have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look Tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. Settle back and clear your mind. We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial I’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies Think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. The power of the universe meanders through your mind. So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find Let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever. Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms A gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity Picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream Dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. Occasionally they kiss our cheeks. Small pleasures; quenching needs Holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; love Now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by The wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost Passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers Strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies The fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift Sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur We find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones The stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer Strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go Contemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us. And as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within Glistening snowflakes fall in flurries. Mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees. Somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you We linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers. Another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems. Perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams Drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare. A path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean. Now, within our reach Eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet. The sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat. We hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread Finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet. It seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat. We dig our toes in cool, wet sand. Then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us. Alone, just you and me Staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together. As minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through Imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon. Birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers. Hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk The sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view. As we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone. Its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone A garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass. A bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past. We wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer. The thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger This feeling washes over us, lost between a sight. And as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me. Then, the scene begins to fade on new reality Deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places. Too surreal to comprehend. Slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call. Entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall Friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots. Some of me, and some of you. Moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion The tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us. But, we’ve only just begun. For now, we dream together of all that is to follow. And now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow Maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight. No matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever. And every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure Goodnight, and sleep well1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

She dealt two cards, a queen and a three And mumbled some words that were so strange to me And then she turned up a two-eyed jack My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black She said, ""The man you love is secretly true To someone else who is very close to you! My advice is that you leave this place Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!"" Dark lady laughed and danced And lit the candles one by one; Danced to her gypsy music Till her brew was done...

Cher,Pop,"It seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh When they know President Joe's passing by  Right now our country is gloomy, fear is in the air But when Joe's president, hope is everywhere Troubles fly away and life is easy go Joe will keep us safe, that's all we need to know Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe  Sometimes thеre seems no end to misery and dеspair But when Joe smiles at us, compassion fills the air Troubles fly away and life is easy flown Joe will keep us safe, that's all we need to know Seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe  President Joe President Joe President JoeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
