## Introduction
This website serves to house the many projects that I have worked on over the years both as a student and as an employee. The projects, code, presenations, and papers featured on this site were entirely or in part produced by me. I wanted to create a lasting container for the many things I have, and will work on. As such, This site will house academic assignments, personal projects, and even professional projects (those that are not protected by non-disclosure agreements). For the academic assignments I have tried to the best of my ability to include the instructions or requirements that were provided. (And any code that may have been supplied to assist in completion). I in no way intend to infringe on the intellectual property of the professors who created these assignments, and will give credit to them wherever it is possible.
